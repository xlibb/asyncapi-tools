The AsyncAPI Specification is a specification, which creates a event driven architecture base contract for APIs 
detailing all of its resources and channels in both human and machine-readable format for easy development, discovery,
and integration. The AsyncAPI tools currently provide the following capabilities.

1. Export the AsyncAPI definition of a Ballerina service.

The `asyncapi1` command in Ballerina is used for Ballerina to AsyncAPI code generations.
